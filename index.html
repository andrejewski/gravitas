      <h1>Gravitas</h1>
      <p>
        Gravitas is a physics based game centered around the force of gravity. 
        The goal of Gravitas is to keep the target mass within the frame for
        as long as possible by creating and destory other masses which will
        pull on the the target mass in strict adherence to the laws of nature.

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
          This game allows you three methods of interaction: creating, enlarging, and destroying masses. 
          Clicking anywhere other than a mass will create a mass in that position.
          Pressing on a mass will increase its mass and thus its attraction force. 
          Clicking (or tapping) on a mass other than the target mass destroys it instantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          This game is made even more challenging by a couple of conditions. 
          First, you cannot destory all of the non-target masses, there always needs to be at least one.
          Second, masses attract all other masses not just the target mass.
          Third, as you progress in the game some predefined havoc ensues.
